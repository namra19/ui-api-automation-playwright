UI & API Automation Framework

Playwright + TypeScript | Page Object Model

This repository contains an automation testing framework built with Playwright and TypeScript, covering both UI tests and API tests in a single unified setup.

The framework follows Page Object Model (POM) principles and supports:

* UI automation (SauceDemo)

* API automation (FakeStore API)

* Positive & negative test scenarios

* Separate execution for UI and API tests

## Tech Stack 
* Playwright

* TypeScript

* Node.js

* Page Object Model (POM)

* Dotenv (environment configuration)

## Applications Under Test 
* UI Application

SauceDemo

URL: https://www.saucedemo.com

* API Application

FakeStore API

Base URL: https://fakestoreapi.com

## Environment Setup 
* Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

Node.js (v18+ recommended)

npm

* Install dependencies
npm install

## Environment variables 
Create a .env file in the root directory:

BASE_URL=https://www.saucedemo.com
API_BASE_URL=https://fakestoreapi.com

## Running Tests 
* Run all tests (UI + API) 

npx playwright test

* Run only UI tests

npx playwright test --project=ui-tests

* Run only API tests

npx playwright test --project=api-tests


## UI Test Architecture 

* UI tests use Page Object Model

* Each page has its own class inside /pages

* Test files interact only with page methods (no selectors in tests)

## API Test Architecture 

* API tests use Playwright’s APIRequestContext

* API logic is separated into API Page Objects

* Shared logic lives in ApiBase

## Test Reports 

After execution, Playwright generates an HTML report.

To view it:

npx playwright show-report
